At the request of the participating schools and childcare centres that are included as project partners in the project, the main aim is to optimise pedagogy and make the teaching, application and assessment of CT more universal and accessible. Special attention is paid to young age groups, inclusion, special educational needs and diversity, viewing differences in abilities as an opportunity and a rich starting point. This Erasmus+ project therefore aims to describe the development of CT in a broad sense, from a broad perspective and through an optimised pedagogical approach to learning, facilitating education, training, assessment and evaluation with regard to the influence, possibilities and benefits of CT. This applies to both the development of children and teachers/childcare workers.

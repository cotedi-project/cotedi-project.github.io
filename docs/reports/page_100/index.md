This activity consisted of starting to use educational robots (bee-bot) to buy food at delicatessen shop. 17 children between 3 and 4 years old from CEIP Pedro Duque (Madrid. Spain) participated in the activity. The activity took place during the week of 11 February (International Day of Women and Girls in Science). Date: 14 February 2024 (1 hour).
Each child decided on a product to buy and had to program the instructions in the beebot to go and buy it. First the steps were counted and then programmed into the robot.

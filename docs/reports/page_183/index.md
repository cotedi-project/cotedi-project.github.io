  In the context of using technology in a different way to develop computational thinking (CT), the CoTEDI project links up with Dr Nardie Fanchamps&#39; research on the application of music producing with electronic software. This is to identify what impact creativity can have on developing CT, and what role can be attributed to different modalities. A scientific journal article is already published.

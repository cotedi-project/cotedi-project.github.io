  Highly visual ICT learning environments offer excellent opportunities to enable meaningful learning about science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Application of such environments can enable tangible experience, lower the level of abstraction and increase imagination, allowing fundamental concepts underlying STEM to be taught in an understandable, meaningful way at an early age. Through inquiry-based learning, stimulation of curiosity, manipulation of concrete materials and through the encouragement of meaningful learning, such ICT learning environments can ensure that elementary school students develop a positive learning attitude and become more motivated for STEM.

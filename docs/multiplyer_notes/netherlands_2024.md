## Panel discussion 

Nardie laid out what computational thinking is. 

Prof. Marcus Specht emphasised on the relevance of CT already in prim schools: "We cannot start early enough to teach and practice computational concepts". This is increasingly important because of its needs in new academic and professional fields as well as in daily practice. "We have to empower children to paint their own pictures"-

Brigitte Sieyenis (MIK& PIW Schools) explained why we must teach children to deal with precedures and tools both, in the physical as well as in the digital realm. 

Henderijn Heldens (dNP) children have to learn how to understand procedures as computation and not think as computation as something that they have to do on top, rather than a logical integration and extension of the existing school subjects. We must help teacher to create connections and not overload teachers. 

Question from the Audience: Gender differences

- Nardie there are gender differences in approaching computational problems.
- Specht gender differences are often driven by stereo types. 
- Maria: strategies of genders change and even flip between boys and girls while growing up. (first boys outperform girls ( up to 5), later girls outperfom boys (by age of 7) (References)).

Question from the Audience: Is school the right place to teach computational thinking. 
- Brigitte emphases that the daily life of children is integrated into their learning process and not separated. MIK and PIW focuses on supporting learning needs of their pupils. 
- Menderijn: schools are designed for learning, but heavily depends on trained teachers. 


- Audience: Schools need to overcome gender biased encouragement.

Nardie: interaction between creativity and CT is important for keeping and raising the motivation

Question from the Audience: Goverments increasingly contraint towards analog teaching and drop screen time in schools
- Specht: if we can get some time from tiktok our problem would be solved. But How do we create quality time on screen. 
- Nardie: Technology now gives way more opportunities than screens. forcing analog technologies completely neglects the complexity of CT that clearly goes beyond the screen.
- Moderator: technology adds a lot of new social elements to common life as well as to schools and lessons. 
- Henderijn: Screen time is only considered negatively, but we need to teach studens how to make good use of the technologies, rather than focussing on negative effects of technology. We need to stress the societal challenges of digital technologies rather than avoiding them. 
- Audience: how about financing school's efforts? 

Question/statement: Could we levage on the short time format of social media for learning (micro learning)?

Question: How does CT relate to the 21st cent skills and would it help?

- Nardie: CT as a the core of 21st cent skills. Already buying a ticket for the train or bus requires 21st skills, but at the core its running down to CT strategies. 
- Henderijn: we need to help children to cope with complexity and complex technologies. "we need to talk about complexity in everyday language". We (teachers) tend to forget that pupils know way more that we expect them to possess. 
- Audience: Aren't schools always lagging the technoligical and societal developments. How can we ask the right questions to students.
- Brigtte: Teachers are challenged by asking the right questions towards the future in order to guide the children. 
- Specht: Teachers must not be afraid of technologies and what their students know about the technology. We need to embrace the different levels of knowledge, concepts, and experiences, otherwise we won't understand the world of tomorrow. 

Question: how does the technology change the role of teachers

- Henderijn: learning design, structure, knowledge to guide students and knowledge about guiding students to structure their own learning. There need to be experts in CT, but not every teacher needs to be CT experts to utilize it in their teaching. 
- Statement: CT is not the core, but an element of our tooling (like reading)

Opportunities and leverage on that children learn all day.

Remark from the audience: Teachers also need to constantly learn and update their knowledge, practices and skills. 

Remark from a teacher: one of the challenges is that learning designs and theories seem clear until one comes to practice and faces that too many things are left open or unclear. 


Final remark of the moderator: We must not forget european spirit in an european project:
- jacket from se
- shirt from PT
- shoes from CH
- parfum from ES

## CoTEDI Objectives (Nardie)

- Target EP: inclusive, adaptive, personal
- interaction between analog and digital for teaching and learning CT
- Understand the function for EP under the special conditions of the children
- Discussion and co-learning across europe
- Can we make the transition from less inclusive, less adaptive, less accessible to more inclusive, more adaptive, more accesslible.

The slides show the data from an initial survey among 71 teachers and school directors. (prim. from NL and PT)

digital skills and ct are as import as training for inclusiion and diversity from the teachers' perspectives. 

robots are currently mostly not used in schools

## Design Idea generation


primary school afternoon activities.

- Cookies baking 
- Cooking
- Shopping 
- Physical games 

## Workshops

Programming a robot in 15 minutes using colors and gestures. 



## Conclusions

- CT is everywhere and all the time 

# Participants

100+ teachers and researchers 

20 lecturers and researchers

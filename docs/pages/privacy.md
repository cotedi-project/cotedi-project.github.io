Welcome to the Privacy Statement of the Project *"Complutational Thinking Education for Diversity and Inclusion"*, hereafter called **CoTEDI**. This is where we describe how we handle your "Personal Data" related to our web-site and project. 

## Demarcation 

The CoTEDI Privacy Statement is restricted to the domain `cotedi.eu`. This 
is typically the first bit that shows in the address bar of your web-browser. 

CoTEDI uses several other services outside of the `cotedi.eu` domain. In such
cases your browser's address bar will not start with `cotedi.eu` or
`https://cotedi.eu`. This privacy statement does not apply to those domains. 
Those web-sites come with their own separate privacy statements, which are 
independent from this privacy statement.

## Use of Cookies

We try hard to avoid the use of cookies and similar mechanisms. As long there are no cookies used, you do not require to accept or reject the use of cookies on this web-site.

Some pages on our web-site may embed resources from other web-sites from 
outside of the `cotedi.eu` domain. Such external resources may use cookies or 
similar technologies. As this is beyond our control, we block such resources 
until you explicitly consent to accessing the external resource. 

## Encryption

All data traffic between you and the CoTEDI web-site is encrypted.

## Access Tracking

This site uses access tracking using a separate online service. 
Access tracking is a way to collect information about how a web-site 
is used. If you access the content of our web-site, this will generate 
some data because your computer loaded some data from our web-site. This data includes: 

- The resource you accessed (e.g., this privacy statement),
- The date and time of your visit,
- The duration the resource was active in your browser, and 
- Your computer's IP adress.

You may opt-out of access-tracking by using your web-browser's 
[**Do Not Track**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track){.external}
feature. If you have activated this feature, CoTEDI will not collect any
personal data about you at all. 

## Privacy and Events

If you participate in CoTEDI events you may appear in media material, such as photos, video recordings and alike. This applies online and physical events alike. By registering to our Events you will have to consent by agreeing to our **media policy**.

We also keep records of event participation for reporting purposes. The registration records are not made public, but are provided to our funding bodies and their partners for evaluating the success of the project.

## Studies and School Projects

CoTEDI studies and school projects and studies **do not** count as CoTEDI 
events. Before you or your child can participate in a CoTEDI 
study or CoTEDI school project you need to sign a **informed consent form**.
Afterwards the participation is recorded but not made public or linked to
empirical data. After the study has completed we will remove any personal 
data from the collected data. Therefore, we will be unable to identiy 
any data related to you or your child once the study or project has completed. 
Therefore, any data related to you or your child that has been collected 
during a study or project cannot be removed from our data after the study or project has been completed.

We may create photos and video recordings during studies and school projects.
These photos are only for internal reporting purposes. You may consent that we
can use these photos and videos for public presentations, trainings and online 
material. For this purpose we will ask you to fill and sign our **media consent 
form** before the start of a study or project. If you do not sign our media 
consent then you or your child can still participate in the study or school 
project, but we **will not** use any photos or videos that allows to identify you or your child.

Any artifacts, such as pictures, sculptures or robots, that you or your child 
created during a study or school project will be documented and can be used in 
public presentations. In this case we carefully remove any connection between 
the artifact and you or your child.

## What we use your data for?

The "Personal Data" is used by the CoTEDI Project for reporting purposes, only.

"dissemination activities", which includes this web-site. I.e, we have to

anything that can be linked to your visits to this web-site.

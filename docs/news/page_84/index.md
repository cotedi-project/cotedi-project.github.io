The book &quot;[Assessing Computational Thinking: An Overview of the Field](https://www.routledge.com/Assessing-Computational-Thinking-An-Overview-of-the-Field/Weintrop-Rutstein-Bienkowski-McGee/p/book/9781032555300)&quot; recently published by Routledge offers interesting insights and valuable perspectives to the CoTeDI project, which aims to develop a common methodology for applying computational thinking (CT) in educational settings. Here’s an analysis of how the book aligns with and supports the CoTeDI project. Among the interesting aspects that could be highlighted, we have identified the points below.

1. Comprehensive Overview of CT Assessment:
   The book provides a detailed exploration of the various methods and contexts in which CT is assessed, reflecting the diversity of approaches needed for effective CT education. This aligns with CoTeDI’s goal to create a variety of activities and materials for CT learning and assessment.

2. Focus on Educational Diversity:
   The book discusses assessments in a wide range of educational settings, from kindergarten to high school, and in both formal and informal contexts. This breadth of coverage supports CoTeDI’s focus on inclusion, diversity, and special educational needs by offering insights into adaptable assessment strategies for diverse student populations.

3. Empirical and Conceptual Foundations:
   By drawing on empirical research and well-established educational theories, the book offers robust frameworks for developing CT assessments. CoTeDI can leverage these frameworks to ensure their activities and assessments are evidence-based and pedagogically sound.

4. Innovative Assessment Methods:
   The book explores various innovative assessment methods, including unplugged activities, portfolio analysis, and the use of learning analytics. These methodologies can inspire CoTeDI’s development of both plugged-in and unplugged CT activities, ensuring they are engaging and effective across different educational contexts.

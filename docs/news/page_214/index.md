The EduRobotX is the annual workshop of the EATEL Educational Robots &amp; Robotics Special Interest Group. It is packed with scientific presentations, sharing of practices, and co-design activities.  

CoTEDI contributed several perspectives on the Educational Robotics. 

First, Annemarie Graus and Nardie Fanchamps discussed *&quot;The Influence of Serious Games and Educational Robotics on Computational Thinking to Promote Reading Abilities and Reading Motivation in Children with Dyslexia&quot;* This contribution explored the cross-curricular effects of computational thinking through motivational robotics.

&lt;/center&gt;

Second in line was Christian Glahn who explored concepts of educational patterns for sharing and exchange of educational practices. His presentation *&quot;Towards Educational Patterns for Teaching Computational Thinking Using Robots&quot;* summarises some lessons learnt from collecting educational practices in the project.

&lt;/center&gt;

Finally, Lisa Bosgoed, Nardie Fanchamps, Heike Gerger, and Roland Klemke presented their findings on *&quot;Computational Thinking by Means of Digital Technology-Enhanced Learning Environments in Special Education&quot;*. This highlights some for the practical findings of our project.

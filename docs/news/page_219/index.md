  CoTEDI presented results from practice in schools at the EduRobotX Workshop at the ECTEL'25 conference in Newcastle & Durham, UK. The presentation focused on the research conducting regarding "The Influence of Serious Games and Educational Robotics on Computational Thinking to Promote Reading Ability and Reading Motivation in Children with Dyslexia." by A.P.L. Graus from BCO educational agency and N.L.J.A. Fanchamps from OUNL.

Presentation during the Workshop addressed the main research question:

* To what extent does the impact on CT via ER or SG have an effect on reading ability and reading motivation in dyslexic children?

It had four sub-questions:

* Can a difference in development on CT in dyslexic children be attributed regarding the application of SG or ER?
* Is a difference in effect measurable on reading ability and reading motivation comparing the application of SG or ER in dyslexic children?
* Is there a measurable difference in reading ability and reading motivation due to differences in the development of CT in dyslexic children?
* What experiential differences do dyslexic children report regarding their reading ability and reading motivation based on the application of SG or ER?

The CoTEDI hackathon will be a 4-day event that takes place from 11-15 February 2026 with onsite activities from 11 to 13 February 2026. 

We will host the event in four locations: The Cologne Game Lab, Rey Juan Carlos University, ZHAW in Zurich, and Kingston University in London. 

[Virtual Soul](https://virtualsoul.es/) is the student association of game design students at Rey Juan Carlos University. Virtual Soul organises the annual [GameGenX Student Fair](https://virtualsoul.es/gamegenX) and connects CoTEDI to the creativity and talent of Spanish game design students. 

Virtual Soul provides the corner stone for the upcoming hackathon in Madrid, Spain. 

The Department of Networks and Digital Media of the [Kingston University London](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/) offers Bachelor and Masters programmes in Game Development. They organise and host game jams for their students to encourange creativity and 

Kingston University London hosts the UK site of the hackathon. 

If your are near our locations, watch this place to get more details soon.

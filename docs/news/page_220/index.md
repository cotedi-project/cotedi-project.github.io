  Many children in special education show impairments in their psychological and socio-pedagogical 
  development. For example, children with intellectual disabilities often experience difficulties in multi-step problems. Previous literature suggests that digital technology-enhanced learning environments not only contribute to computational thinking but might also enhance aspects of psychological and socio-pedagogical development in children from special education. For example, CT-related interventions using educational robotics improved executive functions – particularly response inhibition – in children from special education. However, little is known about how these environments can contribute to the psychological and socio-pedagogical development of children in special educational contexts.

Our work focused on the role that problem solving can have on the socio-pedagogical and psychological dimension. In more detail: the planned research will explore whether CT can foster psychological and socio-pedagogical development in children from special education through learning environments supported by digital technology. Specifically, the planned research will explore whether CT can contribute to social-problem-solving skills in children from special education within the context of digital technology-enhanced learning environments. In addition, teacher practices and the role of children&#39;s task engagement will be explored.
